# Minimal iOS Planner App (SwiftUI + MVVM)

This repository contains a minimal, offline-first iOS planner app scaffold that mirrors the calm, neutral visual style of the ChatGPT iOS app (typography, spacing, and palette only). The code is organized as a SwiftUI + MVVM structure with Core Data ready for persistence.

## Structure
